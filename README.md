Credits
This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base,  are taken from the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera, unless specified otherwise.

2021 Version
This specialization was updated in April 2021 to include developments in deep learning and programming frameworks, with the biggest change being shifting from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2. This repo has been updated accordingly as well.
