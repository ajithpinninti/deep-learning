Credits <br/>
This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base,  are taken from the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera, unless specified otherwise. <br/>

2021 Version <br/>
This specialization was updated in April 2021 to include developments in deep learning and programming frameworks, with the biggest change being shifting from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2. This repo has been updated accordingly as well. <br/>
